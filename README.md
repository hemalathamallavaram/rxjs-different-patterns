# Structure followed
  1. login page just doesnt validate any thing on email or password, but shows that we can detect user is logged in or not with a subject variable
  2. user page just helps in detecting if user is connected to internet or not
  3. random generator component generates random numbers every 2seconds
  4. search messages component, inputs messages and reads them via a subject to the same component. This is a sample, these search messages can be listended over in other components too.
  5. conversations is just a sample code and it doesnt compile , please mind it, only the basic idea is described, models are setup. how rxjs behavioural subjects could be used to store conversations at a central place is the basic idea.
